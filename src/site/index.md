# Welcome to LicenseDB!

Welcome to the License Database project (aka LicenseDB).  Our goal is
to build a structured database of all copyright (and related rights)
licenses used in the free software / open source / free culture
communities.

Various tools can benefit from a full set of machine-readable
licenses, including tools which we haven't thought of yet.  Feel free
to contact us if you have ideas to make this project useful for a
particular use-case.  </p>

## How to help

The License Database project is a very new project, our first goal is
to collect or create RDF/XML files for all the licenses which have an
assigned identifier in the SPDX license list and for all the creative
commons licenses.  These will be made available on
https://licensedb.org/ in both RDF/XML and JSON-LD formats.

Obviously the entire database will be made available as well, and in
particular the JSON-LD files should give many developers in various
programming languages quick and easy access to our metadata.  </p>

If you want to help start by cloning the repository at
[Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/licensedb/licensedb/). Then
come and talk to me, I am "warp" on
[freenode irc](https://www.freenode.net), or e-mail me at
[kuno@frob.nl](mailto:kuno@frob.nl?subject=licensedb).
